# Art of README

This article explores the importance of README files and how to craft them well.

## Etymology
The term "README" dates back to at least the 1970s. All-caps format made it visually striking and ensured it appeared first in directory listings. It signals: *"Important information for the user to read before proceeding."*

## For Creators and Consumers
- **Creators:** Your modules should be lasting and well-documented.  
- **Consumers:** Clear READMEs save time and help understand modules quickly.

## Many Modules: Some Good, Some Bad
Node’s ecosystem has a wide variety of modules. Some have excellent documentation, others none at all. A good README prevents users from having to dive into source code to understand the module.

## Professional Module Spelunking
A README should:  
- Explain what the module is and its purpose  
- Show example usage  
- Provide installation instructions  
- List API details where necessary  
- Include license information  

**Keep it concise**: provide just enough information to understand and use the module.

## Bonus Practices
- Include background when needed  
- Give runnable usage examples  
- Maintain small, clear APIs  
- Use structured sections for easy navigation
